This repo is accompanying with the paper "Heuristic-based Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Coordinating Connected and Automated Vehicles at Non-signalized Intersection", which is currently accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS). The code is developed based on [PyMARL2](https://github.com/hijkzzz/pymarl2).
